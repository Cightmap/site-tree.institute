<p>First things first &ndash; let&rsquo;s talk edibles. Nothing beats the satisfaction of plucking fresh veggies from your own backyard. Here are some surefire winners for your summer vegetable garden:</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h3 id="tomatoesthesummerstaple">Tomatoes: The Summer Staple</h3>

<p>Ah, tomatoes &ndash; the quintessential summer crop. These juicy gems thrive in the heat and come in countless varieties, from bite-sized cherry tomatoes to hefty beefsteaks.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a tomato for every taste bud. Give your tomatoes plenty of sun and support. A sturdy trellis or cage will keep those vines reaching for the sky.</p>

<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to water consistently &ndash; tomatoes are thirsty fellas.</p>

</h3>

<h3 id="peppersbringingtheheatornot">Peppers: Bringing the Heat (or Not)</h3>

<p>Whether you like it mild or wild, peppers are a must-have in any summer garden. Bell peppers offer a sweet crunch, while jalape&ntilde;os and habaneros bring the fire. Peppers grow fast in hot climates and thrive in Hardiness zones 9-11.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t fret if you&rsquo;re in a cooler zone &ndash; they&rsquo;ll still do just fine with a bit of extra TLC. Plant your peppers in an area that gets at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day. </p>

<p> Amend the soil with compost or other organic matter to improve drainage and fertility. Water regularly, especially during dry spells, and fertilize every few weeks to keep your pepper plants healthy and productive.</p>

<h3 id="cucumberscoolasawellyouknow">Cucumbers: Cool as a&hellip; Well, You Know</h3>

<p>Nothing says summer quite like a crisp cucumber. These climbing vines are perfect for maximizing space in your garden. Plus, they&rsquo;re super versatile in the kitchen.</p>

<p>For a refreshing treat, try munching on fresh cucumbers with a sprinkle of salt. Cucumbers are also fantastic in salads.</p>

<p>Try whipping up a German cucumber salad or a zesty <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/thai-cucumber-salad-peanuts?amp=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thai-style cucumber dish</a>. Your taste buds will thank you. </p>

</h3>

<h3 id="zucchinithegardenoverachiever">Zucchini: The Garden Overachiever</h3>

<p>If you want bang for your buck, look no further than zucchini. These prolific plants will have you swimming in squash before you know it. Just remember &ndash; a little goes a long way.</p>

<p>One or two zucchini plants are usually plenty for a family. Don&rsquo;t let your zukes get too big &ndash; they&rsquo;re tastiest when harvested young and tender, around 6-8 inches long.</p>

<p> And if you find yourself with a surplus, there&rsquo;s always zucchini bread. You can also try grilling, saut&eacute;ing, or roasting zucchini for delicious summer meals.</p>

<h2 id="fantasticflowersforsummercolor">Fantastic Flowers for Summer Color</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered the edibles, let&rsquo;s add some eye candy to your garden. These blooming beauties will keep your yard popping with color all summer long. </p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3 id="marigoldstheworkhorseoftheflowerworld">Marigolds: The Workhorse of the Flower World</h3>

<p>Marigolds are like the Swiss Army knife of summer gardens. Not only do they add cheerful pops of orange and yellow, but they also help repel pests from your veggies. Talk about pulling double duty.</p>

<p>These hardy annuals are a cinch to grow from seed, or you can buy marigold plants for instant gratification.</p>

</h3>

<h3 id="zinniasabutterflysbestfriend">Zinnias: A Butterfly&rsquo;s Best Friend</h3>

<p>Want to attract pollinators to your garden? Plant some zinnias. These colorful blooms are like a beacon for butterflies and bees. Plus, they make fantastic cut flowers for indoor bouquets.</p>

<p>Zinnias come in a rainbow of colors and are ridiculously easy to grow. Seriously, just toss some seeds in the ground and watch &rsquo;em go.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ll be blooming their hearts out in no time, adding a vibrant touch to your summer landscape.</p>

	</a></p>

<h3 id="delphiniumsreachingforthesky">Delphiniums: Reaching for the Sky</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to add some vertical interest to your garden, delphiniums are your go-to. These tall, stately flowers come in gorgeous shades of blue, purple, pink, and white. And get this &ndash; some varieties can grow up to 6 feet tall.</p>

<p>Talk about a showstopper. Plant delphiniums in a spot that gets full sun to partial shade.</p>

<p> Just keep in mind that delphiniums prefer cooler climates. If you&rsquo;re in a hot zone, give them some afternoon shade to keep them happy.</p>

<h2 id="herbstheflavormakers">Herbs: The Flavor Makers</h2>

<p>No summer garden is complete without a selection of fresh herbs. Not only do they add instant flavor to your dishes, but many herbs also repel pests and attract beneficial insects. Win-win. </p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3 id="basilthekingofsummerherbs">Basil: The King of Summer Herbs</h3>

<p>Basil and summer go together like peanut butter and jelly. This fragrant herb loves the heat and will keep producing leaves all season long. Just remember to pinch off any flower buds to keep the plant focused on leaf production.</p>

<p>My favorite way to use basil? Whip up a batch of homemade pesto. </p>

<p>Trust me, once you&rsquo;ve tasted fresh pesto, you&rsquo;ll never go back to the store-bought stuff. Basil is also delicious in salads, sandwiches, and pasta dishes.</p>

<h3>

</h3>

<h3 id="cilantroloveitorhateit">Cilantro: Love It or Hate It</h3>

<p>Ah, cilantro &ndash; the Marmite of the herb world. Some folks can&rsquo;t get enough of its bright, citrusy flavor, while others think it tastes like soap.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the cilantro-loving camp, it&rsquo;s a must-have for your summer garden. Plant cilantro in a spot that gets some shade, especially during the hottest part of the day.</p>

<p> Pro tip: Cilantro can bolt (go to seed) quickly in hot weather. Combat this by planting it in partial shade and sowing seeds every few weeks for a continuous harvest.</p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3 id="mintthegardenbullybutweloveitanyway">Mint: The Garden Bully (But We Love It Anyway)</h3>

<p>Mint is the perfect addition to summer cocktails and iced teas. But beware &ndash; this aromatic herb can take over your garden faster than you can say &ldquo;mojito.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To keep it in check, plant mint in containers or use barriers to contain its spreading roots. You can also try growing mint in a pot submerged in the ground to prevent it from spreading too aggressively. </p>

<p> Harvest mint leaves frequently to encourage bushier growth and prevent flowering, which can make the leaves taste bitter.</p>

<h2 id="tipsforsummergardensuccess">Tips for Summer Garden Success</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve covered some excellent choices for what plants are best to go up in my garden this summer, let&rsquo;s talk about how to keep them thriving: </p>

<h3 id="waterwisely">Water Wisely</h3>

<p>Summer heat can be brutal on plants. Water deeply and less frequently to encourage deep root growth.</p>

<p>And remember &ndash; early morning is the best time to water. It gives plants time to absorb the moisture before the heat of the day sets in.</p>

<p> Avoid getting water on the leaves, as this can promote fungal diseases. </p>

<h3>
	<br>
</h3>

<h3 id="mulchlikeapro">Mulch Like a Pro</h3>

<p>A good layer of mulch is like a cozy blanket for your plants&rsquo; roots. It helps retain moisture, suppress weeds, and keep soil temperatures more stable.</p>

<p>Organic mulches like straw or shredded leaves are my go-to. Apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch around your plants, but keep it a few inches away from the stems to prevent rot.</p>

<p>Mulching not only benefits your plants but also gives your garden a neat and tidy appearance. </p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3XP4nCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[There is some mulch here]</a></p>

<h3 id="feedyourfriends">Feed Your Friends</h3>

<p>Summer plants are heavy feeders. Keep them happy with regular applications of organic fertilizer. I&rsquo;m a fan of compost tea &ndash; it&rsquo;s like a smoothie for your plants.</p>

<p>You can also use other organic fertilizers, such as fish emulsion, seaweed extract, or well-rotted manure.</p>

<p> Follow the instructions on the fertilizer package for application rates. </p>

<h3 id="stayontopofpests">Stay on Top of Pests</h3>

<p>Summer heat brings out the bugs. Keep an eye out for common pests like aphids, tomato hornworms, and squash bugs. </p>

<p>Catch them early, and you can often control them with organic methods like handpicking or a strong spray of water.</p>

<p> You can also use insecticidal soap or neem oil for more persistent pest problems. </p>

<h2 id="faqsaboutwhatplantsarebesttogoupinmygardenthissummer">FAQs about What plants are best to go up in my garden this Summer?</h2>

<h3 id="whattoplantinasummervegetablegarden">What to plant in a summer vegetable garden?</h3>

<p>For a thriving summer vegetable garden, consider planting heat-loving crops like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant, and okra.</p>

<p> These vegetables thrive in warm temperatures and long daylight hours. Don&rsquo;t forget to add some herbs like basil and cilantro for fresh flavors in your summer dishes.</p>

<p> Herbs not only enhance the taste of your meals but also attract beneficial insects to your garden. </p>

<h3 id="whatisthebestplanttogrowinthesummer">What is the best plant to grow in the summer?</h3>

<p>While &ldquo;best&rdquo; can vary depending on your specific climate and preferences, tomatoes are often considered the quintessential summer plant. </p>

<p>They thrive in warm weather, are versatile in the kitchen, and come in countless varieties to suit different tastes and garden sizes.</p>

<p> Whether you prefer sweet cherry tomatoes, meaty beefsteak tomatoes, or tangy heirloom varieties, there&rsquo;s a tomato out there for everyone. </p>

<h3 id="whichvegetableisbestinsummer">Which vegetable is best in summer?</h3>

<p>Tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers are all excellent choices for summer vegetables. They love the heat, are productive, and are staples in many summer recipes.</p>

<p> Tomatoes are packed with vitamins and antioxidants, peppers add a kick to your dishes, and cucumbers are refreshing and hydrating. </p>

<p>However, the &ldquo;best&rdquo; vegetable for you will depend on your personal taste preferences and growing conditions. Experiment with different varieties to discover your favorites. </p>

<h3 id="whatisthefastestgrowingplantinthesummer">What is the fastest growing plant in the summer?</h3>

<p>Radishes are among the fastest-growing summer vegetables, often ready to harvest in just 3-4 weeks. They add a peppery crunch to salads and sandwiches. </p>

<p>For quick-growing herbs, try basil or cilantro. These aromatic herbs can be harvested in as little as 6 weeks after planting.</p>

<p>
	In the flower department, zinnias and marigolds can go from seed to bloom in about 6-8 weeks, brightening up your summer garden with their vibrant colors.
