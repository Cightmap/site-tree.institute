<h2 id="planningyoursitemigrationstrategy">Planning Your Site Migration Strategy</h2>

<p>Before moving any files, create a migration plan. This pre-migration phase sets you up for success. Overlooking this can cost businesses time and organic search traffic.</p>

<h3 id="understandingyourexistingwebsite">Understanding Your Existing Website</h3>

<p>Get a snapshot of your current website structure and content. XML sitemaps and website migration checklists can help gather information. Use SEO tools if you didn&#39;t build the site. Tools like SEO.com track a page&rsquo;s SEO performance for pre- and post-migration comparisons.</p>

<p>Gather data from Google Search Console and Google Analytics. Record current SERP positions, target keywords, organic traffic, and backlinks.</p>

<h3 id="settingmigrationgoals">Setting Migration Goals</h3>

<p>Every website migration should have goals. Are you migrating for better security (HTTP to HTTPS), site performance, a new domain, or consolidation?</p>

<p>Knowing your goals determines your benchmarks. Define clear steps with stakeholders (SEO team, developers, content creators) and establish migration best practices. Switching from HTTP to HTTPS requires securing TLS certifications.</p>

<h2 id="seobestpracticesforsitemigration">SEO Best Practices for Site Migration</h2>

<p>A defined process is crucial during any migration. It preserves rankings, ensures a seamless transition, and increases search engine visibility.</p>

<h3 id="creatingaredirectmap">Creating a Redirect Map</h3>

<p>Redirects are essential. 301 redirects guide visitors and search engine crawlers. Conduct a site crawl using Moz Pro or Screaming Frog.</p>

<p>Prioritize important URLs. These will transfer authority to ensure users land on the correct pages.</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Old URL</th>
			<th>New URL</th>
			<th>Redirect Type</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>/old-blog-post</td>
			<td>/new-blog-post</td>
			<td>301</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>/old-product-page</td>
			<td>/new-product-page</td>
			<td>301</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>This is an example; redirect every URL on your site. Avoid broken pages as this increases bounce rates and hurts crawling. These issues are noticeable in Google Analytics reports.</p>

<h3 id="updatinginternallinksandsitemaps">Updating Internal Links and Sitemaps</h3>

<p>Updating internal links helps users navigate your site, which search engines value. Fix broken or old links using ScreamingFrog. Your website architecture guides your internal linking strategy for a logical SEO-driven order.</p>

<h3 id="handling404slikeapro">Handling 404s Like a Pro</h3>

<p>404 errors happen during site migrations. Some pages won&rsquo;t transfer perfectly. Plan beforehand for missing pages.</p>

<h3 id="mobilefriendliness">Mobile Friendliness</h3>

<p>Mobile usability is crucial for site visibility. Google prioritizes mobile-first indexing. Your responsive design should work on smartphones, laptops, and desktops.</p>

<h2 id="postmigrationseochecks">Post-Migration SEO Checks</h2>

<p>Your work doesn&#39;t end after the move. These checks confirm everything is working.</p>

<h3 id="monitoringandreporting">Monitoring and Reporting</h3>

<p>Monitor your site&#39;s performance after migrating. Set up pre- and post-migration reporting benchmarks. Use real-time Google Analytics 4 reports.</p>

<h3 id="respondingtochallenges">Responding to Challenges</h3>

<p>Problems can occur during site migrations. A thorough SEO approach minimizes risks, but no strategy is perfect. Traffic or rankings might fluctuate. Use reports from Google Analytics and Search Console to address challenges proactively.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>SEO best practices for site migration are not one-size-fits-all. Success involves SEO standards, user-focused design, and quality assurance. SEO is a crucial component for maintaining website visibility during migrations.</p>

<p>Following Google&#39;s best practices for site migrations and focusing on user experience can minimize negative impacts on organic search traffic, preserving your rankings while ensuring that visitors find relevant information within their journey along the migration path.</p>
