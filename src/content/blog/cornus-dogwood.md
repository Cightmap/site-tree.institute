<h2 id="typesofcornusdogwoodtrees">Types of Cornus Dogwood Trees</h2>

<p>Ah, the beloved dogwood tree &ndash; a true icon of spring. With so many types of cornus dogwood to choose from, it&rsquo;s like a buffet of blooms. Let&rsquo;s dive into some of the most popular varieties, shall we?</p>

<h3 id="floweringdogwoodcornusflorida">Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida)</h3>

<p>First up, the superstar of the dogwood world: the Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida). This small but mighty tree puts on a spectacular show in spring with its showy white flowers. And just when you think the party&rsquo;s over, it surprises you with bright red fruits in late summer that birds can&rsquo;t resist.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" style="width: 438px; display: block; vertical-align: top; margin: 5px auto; text-align: center;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523524887530-49947cc4a4ee?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzI0ODl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxDb3JudXMlMjBmbG9yaWRhfGVufDB8MHx8fDE3MTkzNDI1MDB8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080" alt="cornus dogwood"></p>

<h3 id="kousadogwoodcornuskousa">Kousa Dogwood (Cornus kousa)</h3>

<p>Next, we have the fashionably late bloomer: the Kousa Dogwood (Cornus kousa). While other dogwoods are winding down, this one&rsquo;s just getting started in June with its unique strawberry-like fruits. Talk about making an entrance.</p>

<h3 id="pacificdogwoodcornusnuttallii">Pacific Dogwood (Cornus nuttallii)</h3>

<p>For those on the West Coast, the Pacific Dogwood (Cornus nuttallii) is the native tree of choice. It&rsquo;s like the laid-back California cousin of the Flowering Dogwood, with similar showy white flowers but a more relaxed vibe.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" style="width: 520px; display: block; vertical-align: top; margin: 5px auto; text-align: center;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518976969788-753caab9d358?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzI0ODl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxNXx8ZG9nd29vZHxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzE5MzM5NDAyfDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080" alt="cornus dogwood"></p>

<h3 id="pagodadogwoodcornusalternifolia">Pagoda Dogwood (Cornus alternifolia)</h3>

<p>Looking for something a little different? Check out the Pagoda Dogwood (Cornus alternifolia), also known as the &ldquo;Alternate-leaf Dogwood.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s got a unique horizontal branching habit that gives it a cool, pagoda-like look. Plus, its leaves alternate on the stems, hence the name. Fancy, huh?</p>

<h3 id="corneliancherrydogwoodcornusmas">Cornelian Cherry Dogwood (Cornus mas)</h3>

<p>Last but not least, we have the Cornelian Cherry Dogwood (Cornus mas). Don&rsquo;t let the name fool you &ndash; it&rsquo;s not actually a cherry tree. But it does have edible fruits that make a tasty jam or jelly. And with its early spring yellow flowers, it&rsquo;s like a ray of sunshine after a long winter.</p>

<h2 id="characteristicsandfeaturesofdogwoodtrees">Characteristics and Features of Dogwood Trees</h2>

<p>Dogwood trees have stolen hearts everywhere. Could it be the delicate pink and white petals unfolding like tiny jewels? Or the astonishing ability to bounce back from tough weather conditions? Whatever the magic ingredient, dogwood trees have won us over, heart by heart.</p>

<h3 id="attractivefallfoliage">Attractive Fall Foliage</h3>

<p>Just when you thought flowering dogwoods couldn&rsquo;t get any better, they put on a stunning fall foliage display. Many species turn shades of red, purple, and burgundy that&rsquo;ll stop you in your tracks. It&rsquo;s like a grand finale to the growing season, with the Flowering Dogwood showing off its purple fall color.</p>

<h3 id="showyspringflowers">Showy Spring Flowers</h3>

<p>Of course, we can&rsquo;t forget about the main event: the spring flowers. Dogwoods are famous for their large, showy bracts that steal the show in spring. Some, like the Flowering Dogwood, have bracts that look like petals in white or pink. Others, like the Kousa Dogwood, have more star-shaped white bracts. Either way, they&rsquo;re a sight to behold.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583298385291-d9fce09c0287?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzI0ODl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxkb2d3b29kfGVufDB8MHx8fDE3MTkzMzk0MDJ8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080" alt="cornus dogwood"></p>

<h3 id="colorfulfruits">Colorful Fruits</h3>

<p>Dogwoods don&rsquo;t just put on a spring show &ndash; they keep the party going with colorful fruits in summer and fall. Flowering Dogwoods have bright red berries that birds love, while Kousa Dogwoods have unique strawberry-like fruits. It&rsquo;s like nature&rsquo;s version of a fruit salad.</p>

<h3 id="versatilelandscapeuses">Versatile Landscape Uses</h3>

<p>Dogwoods are a popular choice for landscaping due to their stunning beauty, low maintenance, and versatility, often being used as focal points, shade, picturesque borders, theme gardens and restoring biodiversity.</p>

<p>These trees can be grouped together to create beautiful dense hedges or privacy screens. They attract birds, butterflies, and other wildlife with their berries, making them an excellent choice for wildlife-friendly landscapes.</p>

<p>Dogwood trees thrive in urban environments, making them an excellent choice for street trees, adding beauty and character to city landscapes; and Dogwoods can tolerate periodic flooding, making them a great choice for rain gardens, which help manage storm-water runoff.</p>

<h3 id="nativetonorthamerica">Native to North America</h3>

<p>Dogwood trees are native and work well as plant anchors in naturalistic gardens, with species like the flowering and Pacific dogwoods stealing the show.</p>

<p>If you decide to plant some in your garden, you&rsquo;ll not only gain a breathtaking view, but also be helping to preserve the balance of your local ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="growingandcaringfordogwoodtrees">Growing and Caring for Dogwood Trees</h2>

<p>As you envision your yard filled with stunning dogwoods, don&rsquo;t forget to consider the logistics of caring for these gorgeous trees. Before planting, research the ideal climate and soil conditions for your new addition. Then, think about giving it the perfect spot, which should have partial shade and top-notch drainage. Once you&rsquo;ve got it all set up, don&rsquo;t forget to provide regular watering and an occasional fertilizer boost. Your dogwood will thrive, and so will your new outdoor space.</p>

<h3 id="plantinglocationandrequirements">Planting Location and Requirements</h3>

<p>Dogwoods are pretty easygoing when it comes to location. They prefer part shade to full sun and well-drained soil. Some species, like the Flowering Dogwood, are hardy in USDA zones 5-9. Just make sure to give them enough space to spread out and do their thing as an understory tree.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1521220733526-d15a376425ec?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzI0ODl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxMnx8c3VuJTIwdHJlZXxlbnwwfDB8fHwxNzE5MzQzODI4fDA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080" alt="cornus dogwood"></p>

<h3 id="wateringandfertilizing">Watering and Fertilizing</h3>

<p>Consistency is key when it comes to watering your dogwood, especially during the first year or two. Water deeply and regularly, and don&rsquo;t forget the mulch to help retain moisture. As for fertilizing, a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in early spring should do the trick.</p>

<h3 id="pruningandmaintenance">Pruning and Maintenance</h3>

<p>Dogwoods don&rsquo;t need a ton of pruning, but a little TLC in late winter or early spring can go a long way. Remove any dead, diseased, or crossing branches to keep your tree looking its best. Just avoid pruning in late summer or fall, or you might encourage new growth that won&rsquo;t have time to toughen up before winter.</p>

<h3 id="commonpestsanddiseases">Common Pests and Diseases</h3>

<p>Even the toughest dogwoods can fall victim to pests and diseases from time to time. Keep an eye out for dogwood anthracnose, powdery mildew, and leaf spot. Pests like dogwood borers and scale insects can also cause trouble. But with regular monitoring and prompt treatment, you can nip these issues in the bud.</p>

<h2 id="companionplantsandlandscapingwithdogwoods">Companion Plants and Landscaping with Dogwoods</h2>

<p>Ready to take your dogwood game to the next level? Try pairing them with some companion plants for a landscape that&rsquo;ll make the neighbors green with envy.</p>

<h3 id="evergreencompanions">Evergreen Companions</h3>

<p>Dogwoods and evergreens go together like peanut butter and jelly. Try planting your dogwood with evergreen shrubs like rhododendrons, American holly (Ilex opaca), or boxwoods for a pop of color that lasts all year. Evergreen groundcovers like pachysandra or vinca can also help fill in the gaps and keep things looking tidy.</p>

<h3 id="deciduouscompanions">Deciduous Companions</h3>

And don&rsquo;t forget about perennials like hostas, ferns, and astilbes to add some interest at ground level.</p>

<h3 id="springfloweringcombinations">Spring-Flowering Combinations</h3>
