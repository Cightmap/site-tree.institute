<h4 id="firststepstocreatingyourgarden">First Steps To Creating Your Garden</h4>

<p>When learning how to start a garden, remember that there&rsquo;s no secret formula for growing plants. A good place to start is understanding your local environment. Each budding garden is a conversation between you, your plants, and the environment.</p>

<p>This includes your climate, soil type, and even the amount of sun exposure your chosen garden spot will receive. It&rsquo;s about working with what you have and choosing plants that will thrive in those conditions.</p>

<h3 id="checkthesunlightplantswillget">Check the Sunlight Plants Will Get</h3>

<p>A sunny spot is like gold to most vegetables. If you&rsquo;re aiming for a bounty of tomatoes, cucumbers, or peppers, choose a spot in your yard that enjoys a good 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Think of it like choosing a good tanning spot for yourself; these sun-loving plants crave the sun&rsquo;s warmth.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4cvbuod" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Check out these Vegetable seeds]</a></p>

<p>But if shade is what you&rsquo;ve got, there&rsquo;s no need to worry. Plenty of flowering plants and vegetables, such as lettuce, spinach, and kale, are partial shade tolerant, needing 4-6 hours of direct sun each day.
</p>

<p>So even if your yard is mostly shady, you can create a garden filled with beauty and bounty. Take a look at your space throughout the day and map out which areas are consistently sunny.</p>

<p>If your heart is set on those delicious tomatoes and all you have is shade, don&rsquo;t give up just yet. Raised beds might be your secret weapon. A well-placed raised bed in a sunny area can make even the shadiest of yards burst with bright red, ripe tomatoes. </p>

<p>The need for sunlight breaks down into four categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Full sun &ndash; 6 or more hours.</li>
	<li>Partial sun &ndash; 4 to 6 hours.</li>
	<li>Partial shade &ndash; 90 minutes to 4 hours.</li>
	<li>Full shade &ndash; less than 90 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507484467459-0c01be16726e?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzI0ODl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw5fHxob3clMjBkbyUyMGklMjBzdGFydCUyMGElMjBnYXJkZW58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTcyMDEwMzQ5MHww&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080" alt="" style="width: 578px;"></p>

<p>Think about where your potential garden will get the most direct sunlight throughout the day. To take out the guesswork and be more precise, use apps like Sun Seeker or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stromming.planta&hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planta</a>. These apps can measure your site&rsquo;s exact exposure and guide you to the perfect spot for each plant. </p>

<h3 id="understandingyourgardensoil">Understanding Your Garden Soil</h3>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve figured out where the sun shines let&rsquo;s get down to earth &ndash; literally. Before you buy garden soil at the local garden center, do a little experiment.</p>

<p>Check the dirt you already have to determine if it&rsquo;s a good foundation for growing plants. It&rsquo;s surprisingly easy to begin, and more often than not, that existing soil will do just fine to start.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t believe those marketing tactics trying to make you spend more at garden centers. Save your money and start exploring that soil. This doesn&rsquo;t just apply to starting vegetable gardens; understanding soil type is helpful for any aspiring gardener.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3xWNo6G" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[But if you do truly need soil, there is some here]</a></p>

<p>So grab your tools and get your hands a little dirty. Loosen the soil by at least 12 inches to allow roots to stretch and thrive. Clear any debris from the area, and just like that, your soil is prepped and ready.
</p>

<h2 id="thebesttypesofgardensforbeginners">The Best Types of Gardens for Beginners</h2>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve found the perfect sunny spot in your backyard and have started checking out the soil, it&rsquo;s time for the exciting part &ndash; figuring out what to plant. But this leads to another question: which type of garden should you choose?</p>

<p> This really boils down to two things &ndash; what do you want your garden to do, and how much space do you have for it? Let&rsquo;s delve into some popular garden types perfect for beginners.</p>

<h3 id="vegetablegardens">Vegetable Gardens</h3>

<p>Vegetable gardens are a fantastic way to connect with nature and enjoy the fruits (and vegetables.) of your labor. Imagine, home-grown produce fresh from the ground.</p>

<p>You decide which seeds you plant, how much you plant, what to fertilize with, and how often you want to harvest your food. With careful planning, you can pick a variety of vegetables that give you fresh produce for most of the growing season. </p>

<p>Not only is the produce fresher than anything at the grocery store, but growing your own food can also save you money. There are other unexpected perks that come with gardening too, such as healthy meals, more family time outdoors, and some healthy exercise, all while making your property beautiful and attracting all sorts of birds, bees, and butterflies to your yard.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/4eNYQSX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[If you were interested in giving a place for birds to call home, check these out]</a></p>

<p>Plus, the simple act of tending a vegetable garden brings a certain level of calm and tranquility that can feel almost meditative. However, it does require a level of commitment and routine maintenance, from regular weeding to vigilant pest control and ensuring a steady water source, so choose this if you enjoy rolling up your sleeves and putting in the work.</p>

<p><img src="https://app.contentatscale.ai/uploader/uploads/2024/07/1720103713_IMG9471-Edit-3144227jpg" style="display: block; vertical-align: top; margin: 5px auto 5px 0px; text-align: left; width: 502px;"></p>

<h3 id="raisedgardenbeds">Raised Garden Beds</h3>

<p>Raised garden beds are like islands of carefully crafted ecosystems in your own yard. They look neat, are easy to maintain, give great drainage, and minimize back pain that comes with tending those low-lying standard garden beds. It&rsquo;s like having your own mini farm.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got complete control &ndash; filling it with that awesome soil mix specifically tailored to the plant&rsquo;s needs, positioning it precisely to grab that perfect sun exposure, and adding things to protect against encroaching pests or pesky weed seeds.</p>

<p>Raised garden beds are ideal for those with limited yard space, especially in an urban environment. Plus, if you need a handicap accessible garden because of a physical limitation, you can custom build a raised bed to the right height. This brings us to our next common newbie garden: the humble ground garden.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3VRhQXZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[It would be most cost efficient to build your own raised garden beds, but you can also check these out here]</a></p>

<h3 id="groundgardens">Ground Gardens </h3>

<p>Ground gardens are the most traditional type of garden and are a great option if you have plenty of space. You simply pick a patch of land, prepare the existing ground by adding nutrient-rich compost and digging a little, pop your seedlings or seeds in, water consistently, and stand back to watch the magic unfold.</p>

<p>Although you have less control than with a raised bed, and you will be spending a lot of time hunched over battling those weeds, ground gardens have benefits, especially for plants that like to send down some deep roots. </p>

<h2 id="essentialtoolsyoullneed">Essential Tools You&rsquo;ll Need</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve figured out where our little plant utopia will be, what it is going to hold, and what it will be made of, it&rsquo;s time to stock your arsenal. Every great adventure requires the right gear, and starting a garden is no different. It may seem overwhelming to think about purchasing so many new tools, but let&rsquo;s break down the essential equipment to ensure your garden start goes smoothly.</p>
<hr id="isPasted">

<p><strong>Gardening Equipment</strong></p>

<h2 id="preparingforyourgardenstart">Preparing for Your Garden Start</h2>

<p>If you want to be really successful as a newbie gardener, you&rsquo;ve got to plan. Trust me on this; as an experienced gardener, the thrill of wandering the rows of brightly colored seed packets can make you lose track of practicality. </p>

<p>And yes, sometimes, grabbing those plant tags that simply catch your eye can work. However, starting your garden is a great exercise in mindfulness. It all boils down to taking a step back and getting grounded before even stepping into that garden bed. </p>

<h3><img src="https://app.contentatscale.ai/uploader/uploads/2024/07/1720103830_Rx63edvSZCZ9uSg7egSDRU-1200-80jpg" style="display: block; vertical-align: top; margin: 5px auto 5px 0px; text-align: left; width: 635px;"></h3>

<h3 id="developingagardenplan">Developing A Garden Plan</h3>

<p>First things first &ndash; check the hardiness zone you live in and try to visit your local garden center. This helps ensure the plants you buy will enjoy being in your region.</p>

<p>Next up &ndash; envision that amazing green haven you&rsquo;re planning on building. A few moments jotting down notes, rough sketching, or doodling ideas on paper will help tremendously as you move forward with the project.</p>

<p>As experienced gardeners like to say: &ldquo;Failure to plan is planning to fail.&rdquo; I know that sounds cliche, but seriously, I can&rsquo;t even count how many mistakes I&rsquo;ve made throughout the years by being unprepared.</p>

<p>One key part of planning is learning when it&rsquo;s the best planting time based on what you&rsquo;ve chosen. You wouldn&rsquo;t want to put delicate plants like tomatoes outside when there&rsquo;s still a risk of frost. That would be an unwelcome surprise for those plants, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>Refer back to those seed packets. They&rsquo;ll tell you how much room your chosen plants need so that everything has plenty of room to breathe as it grows. And this leads to one more crucial factor: planning to ensure a constant water source, especially if there&rsquo;s a drought in your region. </p>

<h3 id="preppingthegardensite">Prepping the Garden Site</h3>

<p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to face those pesky intruders &ndash; the unwanted plants that think your perfectly prepared garden soil is a buffet. Those weeds can quickly grow out of control. It&rsquo;s far easier to address them before they take over. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, I have solutions for this too. You&rsquo;ll need to remove the existing grass &ndash; or maybe create the garden somewhere else. There are ways to prevent weed seeds from sprouting as soon as you clear the grass. </p>

<p> The secret to weed protection is cutting off the sun&rsquo;s rays that the seeds need to germinate. Laying down landscape fabric beneath the top soil is an excellent barrier. Another great option is an inch layer of organic mulch.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3RWiy4S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[There is some landscape fabric here]</a></p>

<p><img src="https://app.contentatscale.ai/uploader/uploads/2024/07/1720103903_april-w2-assets-lasangagardening-homepage-blogjpg" style="display: block; vertical-align: top; margin: 5px auto 5px 0px; text-align: left; width: 603px;"></p>

<h3 id="lasagnagardeningtogetridofexistinggrass">Lasagna Gardening to Get Rid of Existing Grass</h3>

<p>This technique really revolutionized my gardens, and it&rsquo;ll do the same for you. It takes a few months and uses materials you already have. This technique lets you turn grass into garden beds without breaking your back or needing heavy machinery.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s essentially sheet mulching, an ecological trick that utilizes readily available materials, transforming them into rich compost. First, cover that future garden area with old cardboard (without any plastic on it), overlap it for total coverage, and give it a good soak.</p>

<p>Layer organic material, like leaves or straw, to add a layer of richness. Over a few months, earthworms break everything down to turn your weedy, grassy patches into nutrient-dense ground gardens ready to plant. </p>

<h2 id="startingfromseedsversusyoungplants">Starting From Seeds Versus Young Plants</h2>

<p>Deciding whether to sow seeds or opt for starter plants is another important decision. Seeds offer a rewarding and cheap journey from the moment the first sprouts peek out of the soil. </p>

<p>Starter plants make the initial steps easy &ndash; giving a faster transition and saving you valuable growing season time. Both options have their pros and cons, so let&rsquo;s explore them further.</p>

<h3 id="sowingseedsindoors">Sowing Seeds Indoors</h3>

<p>Sowing those seeds indoors means a slightly earlier start to the gardening season. Imagine a window sill blooming with little seedlings ready to transfer into the outside garden bed.</p>

<p>Use seedling trays and soil mixtures. Be diligent by providing proper sunlight, enough water, and stable temperatures, and once your outdoor soil and weather warm, you&rsquo;ve got healthy young plants ready to transfer. You can easily find the optimal time to start your seeds online. </p>

<h2 id="abeginnergardenersmusthaves">A Beginner Gardener&rsquo;s &ldquo;Must Haves&rdquo;</h2>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to invest in everything on your first try, but some supplies and tricks of the trade will help your initial garden start. These must-have items ensure success and keep those new plants happy.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1471194402529-8e0f5a675de6?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzI0ODl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyNXx8cmFpc2VkJTIwZ2FyZGVuJTIwYmVkfGVufDB8MHx8fDE3MjAxMDM2MDB8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080" alt="" style="width: 605px;"></p>

<h3 id="protectingvulnerablenewplants">Protecting Vulnerable New Plants</h3>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3zsWA3g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Organic mulch</a> can serve many purposes, including protecting fragile new plantings and offering consistent hydration by lessening evaporation. Plus, it keeps temperatures consistent and cuts back on those relentless weeds. </p>

<p>Apply an inch of shredded bark mulch directly onto the garden soil, creating a tidy protective layer while deterring unwanted visitors.</p>

<h3 id="wateringcorrectly">Watering Correctly </h3>

<p>The golden rule for a great start is to provide a water source whenever the top layer of soil feels dry, mimicking natural rainfalls. While each plant has unique needs, a great tip is to give in-ground gardens a thorough soaking at least three times each week.</p>

<p>Morning watering is perfect for allowing enough time to absorb that vital hydration before those strong midday sun rays heat everything.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578302758063-0ef3e048ca89?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wyNzI0ODl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyMnx8cmFpc2VkJTIwZ2FyZGVuJTIwYmVkfGVufDB8MHx8fDE3MjAxMDM2MDB8MA&ixlib=rb-4.0.3&q=80&w=1080" alt="" style="width: 568px;"></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion: Remember to pick a spot in your backyard, test your soil and amend as necessary, make a plan to address those weeds, choose what kind of garden fits your vision, decide whether to start with seeds indoors or buy those ready-made plants, and gather all the supplies that you&rsquo;ll need. </p>

<p>These steps, although seeming daunting at first, will break down each challenge into small, manageable steps. Gardening is a rewarding hobby that can provide you with fresh food, beautiful flowers, and a sense of accomplishment. So get out there and get your hands dirty &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be glad you did.</p>
